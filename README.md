# SpringBootCaching
Personal project to learn Caching through SpringBoot
Seeing what I can learn about caching!

NOTE:  Uses a "JavaFaker" class that will generate a variety of randomized names and user details.
Ideally we would want to have an actual database to store this data, but for spinning up an App, its a place to start!

_I haven't given up on this project... I just haven't had any time to work on it.  My real work, and raising a family, trumps my side projects._
